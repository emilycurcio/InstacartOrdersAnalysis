# InstacartOrdersAnalysis
Project using Python to analyze Instacart data.

### Project Description:
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The goal of this project is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Key questions that the marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in include:
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status? Region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

### Data:
Data set contains public data “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017” accessed via Kaggle on March 2024. Data set also contains fictional customer data.
